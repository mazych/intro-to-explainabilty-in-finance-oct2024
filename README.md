# What's inside the box? An introduction to explainability in finance
### Presentation: [Explainability in finance](workshop/Explainability.pptx)

## Workshop description
Building a machine learning model is just one piece of the puzzle in data science; explaining how it works is just as important, especially in finance where transparency and explainability are key.

During this workshop, we'll show you how to look inside your model and understand whatâ€™s going on. We'll explore techniques to make your models easier to explain and discuss their opportunities and downfalls.
